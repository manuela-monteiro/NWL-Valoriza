# NWL-Valoriza
API with a SQL DB developed during Backend studies at Rocketseat

This application brings CRUD of users and compliments that they could register for each other, and there we can see the use of relationships between tables with TypeScript and Type ORM. Also, there will be work on validations with JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN) and modularization, for a clean and efficient code.

To see the code that is available for now, please check the "master" branch.
